# Quantum-tech-papers
This repo contains some of the papers and publications, I have read over the past few months, that pertain to quantum technology development.
It is not a curated list of the most recommended publications for a beginner in the quantum networking field, but rather a journal (of sorts) that depics my journey through publications.
