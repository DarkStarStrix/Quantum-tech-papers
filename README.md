# Quantum-networking-papers
This repo contains some of the papers and publications, I have read over the past few months, that pertain to quantum technology development.
It is not a curated list of the most recommended publications for a beginner in the quantum networking field, but rather a journal (of sorts) that depics my journey through publications.
Re-curring topics on this list are:
- Quantum protocol design
- Quantum algorithms
- Silicon based quantum technologies
- The Hong-Our-Mandel effect
- Quantum circuits 
- Electron-spin states
- Commercial and philosophical views on quantum technologies
- Quantum repreater achitectures
- Experimental simulating tools
